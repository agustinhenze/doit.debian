## issues/bugs

If you find issues using `doit` please report at
[github issues](https://github.com/pydoit/doit/issues).

All issues should contain a sample minimal `dodo.py` and
the used command line to reproduce the problem.


## questions

Please ask question in the discussion
[forum](http://groups.google.co.in/group/python-doit).
Do not use the github issue tracker!

`doit` has extensive online documentation please read the docs!

When asking a question it is appreciated if you introduce yourself,
also mention how long are you using doit and using it for what.

A good question with a code example greatly increases the chance
of it getting a reply.

Unless you are looking for paid support, do **not** send private emails
to the project maintainer.


## feature request

Users are expected to implement new features themselves.
You are welcome to add a request on github tracker but if you are not willing
to spend your time on it, probably nobody else will...

Before you start implementing anything it is a good idea to discuss its
implementation in the discussion forum.
