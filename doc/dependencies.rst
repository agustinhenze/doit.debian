======================
Dependencies & Targets
======================


up-to-date tasks
--------------------

One of the main ideas of `doit` (and other build-tools) is to check if the
tasks/targets are **up-to-date**. In case there is no modification in the
dependencies and the targets already exist, it skips the task execution to
save time, as it would produce the same output from the previous run.

Dependency
  A dependency indicates an input to the task execution.

Target
  A *target* is the result/output file produced by the task execution.


i.e. In a compilation task the source file is a *file_dep*,
the object file is a *target*.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/compile.py


`doit` automatically keeps track of file dependencies. It saves the
signature (MD5) of the dependencies every time the task is completed successfully.

So if there are no modifications to the dependencies and you run `doit` again.
The execution of the task's actions is skipped.


.. code-block:: console

  $ doit
  .  compile
  $ doit
  -- compile

Note the ``--`` (2 dashes, one space) on the command output on the second
time it is executed. It means, this task was up-to-date and not executed.


file_dep (file dependency)
-----------------------------

Different from most build-tools dependencies are on tasks, not on targets.
So `doit` can take advantage of the "execute only if not up-to-date" feature
even for tasks that not define targets.

Lets say you work with a dynamic language (python in this example).
You don't need to compile anything but you probably wants to apply a lint-like
tool (`PyChecker <http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/>`_) to your
source code files. You can define the source code as a dependency to the task.


.. literalinclude:: tutorial/checker.py

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   .  checker
   $ doit
   -- checker

Note the ``--`` again to indicate the execution was skipped.

Traditional build-tools can only handle files as "dependencies".
`doit` has several ways to check for dependencies, those will be introduced later.


targets
-------

Targets can be any file path (a file or folder). If a target doesn't exist
the task will be executed. There is no limitation on the number of targets
a task may define. Two different tasks can not have the same target.

Lets take the compilation example again.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/compile.py

If there are no changes in the dependency the task execution is skipped.
But if the target is removed the task is also executed again. But only if
does not exist. If the target is modified but the dependencies do not
change the task is not executed again.

.. code-block:: console

    $ doit
    .  compile
    $ doit
    -- compile
    $ rm main.o
    $ doit
    .  compile
    $ echo xxx > main.o
    $ doit
    -- compile


execution order
-----------------

If your tasks interact in a way where the target (output) of one task is a
file_dep (input) of another task, `doit` will make sure your tasks are
executed in the correct order.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/taskorder.py

.. code-block:: console

  $ doit
  .  create
  .  modify



uptodate
----------

Apart from file dependencies you can extend `doit` to support other ways
to determine if a task is up-to-date throught the attribute ``uptodate``.

This can be used in cases where you need to some kind of calculation to
determine if the task is up-to-date or not. i.e. you check if a
value in a database is smaller than a certain value.

``uptodate`` is a list where each element can be True, False, None or a callable.

 * ``False`` indicates that the task is NOT up-to-date
 * ``True`` indicates that the task is up-to-date
 * ``None`` values will just be ignored. This is used when the value is dinamically calculated

.. note::

  ``uptodate`` value ``True`` does not override others up-to-date checks.
   It is one more way to check if task is **not** up-to-date.

   i.e. if uptodate==True but a file_dep changes the task is still
   considered **not** up-to-date.


``uptodate`` elements can also be a callable that returns False, True or None.
The section ``custom-uptodate`` will explain in details how to extend `doit`
writing your own callables for ``uptodate``. This callables will tipically
compare a value on the present time with a value calculated on the last
successful execution.

`doit` includes several implementations to be used as ``uptodate``.
They are all included in module `doit.tools` and will be discussed in detail
later:

  * ``result_dep``: check if the result of another task has changed
  * ``run_once``: execute a task only once (used for tasks wihtout dependencies)
  * ``timeout``: indicate that a task should "expire" after a certain time interval
  * ``config_changed``: check for changes in a "configuration" string or dictionary
  * ``check_timestamp_unchanged``: check access, status change/create or modify timestamp of a given file/directory

.. note::

  If you want to use other tasks to calculate ``uptodate`` you should combine it with ``calc_deps``.



doit up-to-date definition
-----------------------------

A task is **not** up-to-date if any of `file_dep` or `uptodate` is not up-to-date
or there is a missing `target`.
If a task does not define any of these dependencies it will always be executed.

Apart from these dependencies used to determine if a task is up-to-date or not.
``doit`` also include other kind of dependencies to help you combine tasks
so they are executed in appropriate order.



task-dependency
---------------

It is used to enforce tasks are executed on the desired order.
By default tasks are executed on the same order as they were defined in
the `dodo` file. To define a dependency on another task use the
task name (whatever comes after ``task_`` on the function name) in the
"task_dep" attribute.


.. note::

  A *task-dependency* **only** indicates that another task should be "executed"
  before itself. The task-dependency might not really be executed if it
  is *up-to-date*.

.. note::

  *task-dependencies* are **not** used to determine if a task is up-to-date or
  not. If a task defines only *task-dependency* it will always be executed.


This example we make sure we include a file with the latest revision number of
the mercurial repository on the tar file.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tar.py

.. code-block:: console

    $ doit
    .  version
    .  tar


.. note::

  a *task-dependency* is executed before checking if the task is up-to-date.
  If you want to execute another task only if it is not up-to-date you should
  use a ``setup`` task (as described later).


groups
^^^^^^^

You can define group of tasks by adding tasks as dependencies and setting
its `actions` to ``None``.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/group.py

Note that tasks are never executed twice in the same "run".


calculated-dependencies
------------------------

Calculation of dependencies might be an expensive operation, so not suitable
to be done on task-creators. For this situation is better to delegate
the calculation of dependencies to another task.
The task calcutating dependencies must have a python-action returning a
dictionary with `file_dep`, `task_dep`, `uptodate` or another `calc_dep`.

On the example below ``mod_deps`` prints on the screen all direct dependencies
from a module. The dependencies itself are calculated on task ``get_dep``
(note: get_dep has a fake implementation where the results are taken from a dict).


.. literalinclude:: tutorial/calc_dep.py



setup-task
-------------

Some tasks require some kind of environment setup.
Tasks may have a list of "setup" tasks.

* the setup-task will be executed only if the task is to be executed (not up-to-date)
* setup-tasks are just normal tasks that follow all other task behavior


teardown
^^^^^^^^^^^
Task may also define 'teardown' actions.
These actions are executed after all tasks have finished their execution.
They are executed in reverse order their tasks were executed.


Example:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tsetup.py


saving computed values
------------------------

Tasks can save computed values by returning a dictionary on it's python-actions.
The values must be JSON encodable.

These values can be used on uptodate_ and getargs_.
Check those sections for examples.



getargs
--------

`getargs` provides a way to use values computed from one task in another task.
The values are taken from "saved computed values"
(returned dict from a python-action).

For *cmd-action* use dictionary-based string formatting.

For *python-action* the action callable parameter names must match with keys
from `getargs`.

`getargs` is a dictionary where the key is the argument name used on actions,
and the value is a tuple with 2 strings: task name, "value name".

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/getargs.py


The values are being passed on to a python-action you can pass the whole dict
by specifying the value name as ``None``.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/getargs_dict.py


If a group-task is used, the values from all its sub-tasks are passed as a list.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/getargs_group.py


.. note::
   ``getargs`` creates an implicit setup-task.



keywords on actions
--------------------

It is common situation to use task information such as *targets*,
*dependencies*, or *changed* in its own actions.
Note: Dependencies here refers only to *file-dependencies*.

For *cmd-action* you can use the python notation for keyword substitution
on strings. The string will contain all values separated by a space (" ").

For *python-action* create a parameter in the function, `doit` will take care
of passing the value when the function is called.
The values are passed as list of strings.
