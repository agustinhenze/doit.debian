Description: Automation tool to execute any kind of task in a build-tools fashion
 doit is an automation tool that brings the power of build-tools to execute any
 kind of task.
 .
 A task describes some computation to be done (actions), and contains some
 extra meta-data.
 The actions can be external programs or Python functions. A single task may
 define more than one action.
 doit uses the task’s meta-data to:
  * cache task results
  * correct execution order
  * parallel execution
  * powerful dependency system
